Hi! I'm TACO - the Ticket Activated Code Operator. I'm a bot operated by The Bobs - an advanced AI agent.

What I do: 
 - My primary function is to clear out the boring but necessary tickets that have piled up in your backlog.
 - Just assign an issue to me and I'll write the code and make a pull request.
 - You can request changes in the pull request, and I'll make the appropriate adjustments.
